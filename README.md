# README for Projects Inspired by "The Self-Taught Computer Scientist" by Cory Althoff

Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio of projects inspired by "The Self-Taught Computer Scientist" by Cory Althoff. This collection
showcases my journey through self-taught computer science concepts, emphasizing practical applications and
problem-solving skills. Each project embodies the principles and challenges discussed in the book, aiming to demonstrate
my understanding and capabilities in software development.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of these projects are to:

- Apply theoretical computer science concepts.
- Develop a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, programming paradigms, and software engineering principles.
- Showcase problem-solving skills and creativity through diverse challenges.
- Prepare for technical interviews and career opportunities in software development.

## Projects Overview

- **Chapter 2:** [Recursion](https://github.com/MarkovianPD/SelfTaughtComputerScientist/blob/main/recursion.py) In this
  chapter, we delve into the concept of recursion, marking our first of many interactive challenges. The challenge
  presented here encourages you to engage directly with the concept by implementing a recursive function to print
  numbers from 1 to 10. This exercise goes beyond deepening my understanding of recursion; it puts my theoretical
  knowledge to work, laying the groundwork for tackling more complex challenges that await.

## Conclusion

This portfolio represents a significant step in my journey as a self-taught computer scientist. Each project is a
testament to the dedication, learning, and application of computer science principles in solving real-world problems. I
look forward to further opportunities to grow and contribute to exciting and impactful software development projects.
